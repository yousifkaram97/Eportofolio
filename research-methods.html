		<p><b>This unit helped me understand what research is and why it matters. I learned that research is a step-by-step way of finding out new things, checking if something is true, or solving problems. Before this module, I thought research was only for school or science. But now I see that it is also useful in jobs, government work, and helping communities. I learned the difference between two types of research. Basic research is about learning more and growing knowledge. Applied research is used to fix real-world problems.
I also learned that being honest and fair is very important in research. This unit showed me that research is not just a method. It is also a way of thinking—asking questions and using facts to find answers.</b></p>

		<p><B>Unit 2 taught me how important it is to ask a clear and researchable question. At first, I thought it was easy—just choose a topic. But I learned that a good question shapes the whole research project.
We used the PICO and SMART frameworks to help create better questions. I liked the SMART method the most. It stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. I used it to make a question about urban transport and accessibility. It helped me take a big idea and turn it into a clear, focused question.
We also talked about how research questions can change over time. This was new to me. I used to think once you write a question, it stays the same. But now I see it's normal to change it as you learn more. Reading articles and getting feedback helped me make my question better. This showed me that being flexible is important in research.</B></p>

		<p><b>This unit helped me understand the difference between methodology and methods. Methodology is the big plan or approach to doing research. Methods are the tools we use, like interviews or surveys. At first, I found it hard to tell them apart. But examples made it clearer. For example, a qualitative methodology might use interviews. A quantitative one might use surveys or numbers.
We also learned about three main research types: positivism, interpretivism, and critical realism. These are called research paradigms. They are different ways of thinking about the world. Positivism believes there is one truth we can measure. Interpretivism tries to understand people’s feelings and thoughts. Critical realism looks at both the real world and people’s views of it.
I thought about what fits best with my own interests. I like studying people and how they behave. So I feel closer to interpretivism. Knowing this will help me choose the right tools in future research. It will make sure my research matches my goals.</b></p>

		<p><b>This unit deepened my understanding of qualitative methods. I found the case study method particularly interesting, as it allows for in-depth analysis of a single case or a small number of cases within a real-life context). During class discussions, we analysed examples of case studies in healthcare and urban planning, which showed me how rich data can emerge from close observation and contextual analysis.
I learned about focus groups as a method of generating group-based insights through facilitated discussion. I initially assumed that focus groups would yield chaotic or shallow results, but I learned that, when properly moderated, they can reveal diverse perspectives and encourage participants to reflect more deeply than in one-on-one interviews.
The concept of participant observation intrigued me because of its immersive nature, particularly in ethnographic studies. However, I recognised the ethical and practical challenges of this method, such as gaining access, maintaining objectivity, and protecting confidentiality.</b></p>

		<p><b>This unit contrasted two of the most commonly used data collection methods: interviews and surveys. Through practical exercises, I learned how to design both open-ended and closed-ended questions and how each type serves different research aims.
Interviews appealed to me because they offer depth, flexibility, and the ability to explore complex topics. However, I realised how time-consuming they can be in terms of transcription and analysis. I practiced conducting a semi-structured interview with a classmate, which improved my communication and listening skills. The exercise taught me the importance of neutrality and avoiding leading questions.
On the other hand, I learned that surveys are better suited for gathering data from larger populations, particularly when looking for generalisable trends. I became familiar with tools like Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, and I learned how to use Likert scales, demographic questions, and branching logic effectively. This unit increased my confidence in designing tools for both qualitative and quantitative data collection.</b></p>

		<p><b>Quantitative methods initially seemed intimidating because of their reliance on numbers and statistics. However, this unit helped me overcome that fear by breaking down statistical concepts into understandable components. I learned about descriptive statistics—such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation—and how these measures help summarise data.
We covered inferential techniques like correlation and t-tests. A hands-on workshop using SPSS introduced me to statistical software, and although I found the interface overwhelming at first, I managed to conduct basic analysis by the end of the session.
Understanding the strengths of quantitative methods, especially their potential for generalisation, gave me a new appreciation for surveys and experiments. However, I learned that poor design or biased samples can compromise validity, which underscored the importance of careful planning and ethical conduct.</b></p>

		<p><b>This unit built upon the previous one by diving deeper into inferential statistics. I learned how to formulate null and alternative hypotheses and how to interpret p-values and confidence intervals. We discussed common tests like the chi-square test, ANOVA, and linear regression.
What stood out to me most was understanding the logic behind hypothesis testing. Rather than seeking to “prove” a hypothesis, the goal is to test whether the data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This distinction shifted how I think about certainty in research—there’s always a margin of error, and we must be cautious in drawing conclusions.
While I’m still developing fluency with these techniques, the exercises in class and the resources provided (such as Field’s Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS) helped make the content more accessible.</b></p>

I learned the importance of selecting the right type of visualisation for the data—such as histograms for distributions, scatterplots for relationships, and bar charts for comparisons.
We were introduced to tools like Excel, SPSS, and Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) for data visualisation. While I had used Excel before, I was new to Python. I appreciated how powerful it is, even though I found the coding syntax difficult at first. With some guidance and experimentation, I managed to generate clear visual representations of survey data.
I learned that visuals can be misleading if poorly designed—for example, by manipulating axis scales or omitting relevant data. This reinforced the need for ethical and transparent data presentation in research.</b></p>

		<p><b>This unit focused on assessing the quality of research, particularly the concepts of validity, reliability, and generalisability. I learned that internal validity refers to whether the research design truly captures what it intends to, while external validity relates to whether the findings can be applied to other contexts or populations.
We discussed various threats to validity, such as selection bias, attrition, and instrumentation. In group activities, we evaluated published studies to identify potential validity concerns, which helped me understand these issues more concretely.
The unit addressed the trade-offs between depth and generalisability—for example, case studies may offer deep insights but have limited generalisability. I now appreciate that researchers must be transparent about these limitations in their work.</b></p>

Practicing writing short summaries and abstracts improved my ability to communicate complex ideas concisely. One of the most useful tips I learned was to write the methods section early, as it is based on fixed procedures, and to leave the introduction and abstract for last.
This unit emphasised the importance of writing as an ongoing process involving drafting, feedback, and revision. I found peer review activities helpful, both in receiving constructive criticism and learning from how others approach writing.</b></p>

		<p><b>This unit guided us in reflecting on our overall development and preparing a professional e-Portfolio. I found this valuable not only for assessment but for future job applications. Reflecting on my skills across units helped me identify strengths (e.g., qualitative research design) and areas for improvement (e.g., quantitative analysis).
We created a Professional Skills Matrix, mapping our competencies in areas such as critical thinking, communication, digital literacy, and ethical awareness. This activity helped me set realistic goals for my development and appreciate the broader relevance of research skills in many careers.</b></p>

		<p><b>In this final unit, we explored how to plan and manage research projects, including risk identification and mitigation. I learned about tools like Gantt charts and risk registers, which I had never used before. These tools showed me how important it is to consider timelines, resource allocation, and potential setbacks in advance.
I learned about research governance, such as institutional review boards and data protection policies. This gave me a broader understanding of the systems that support ethical and reliable research.
Through a simulation exercise, we identified risks like participant dropout, data loss, and funding issues, and developed contingency plans. This unit taught me that successful research is not just about ideas—it’s about organisation, communication, and accountability.</b></p>
